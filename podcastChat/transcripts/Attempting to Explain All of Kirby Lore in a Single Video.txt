 Long ago, in a time before pink puffs and air rides, there lived the ancients, an entire  civilization completely shrouded in mystery, safe for a few key relics they left behind.  But who cares about any of that, because on an unrelated planet far, far away, there lived  an innocent pink puff named Kirby, a being of unlimited power who usually likes to  spend his days eating, sleeping, or some variation of the two.  However, this would all change when a certain self-proclaimed monarch would steal all the  food in Dreamland, initiating a rivalry that would be sure to last an eternity, or at least  when they felt like it.  As while King Dedede would be the first antagonist of the Kirby timeline, he'd soon transition  into less of an actual villain and more of an ally-slash-punching bag for Kirby to wail  on in just about every game in the series.  Since whether it be Dedede trying to prevent Kirby from releasing an actual nightmare demon,  or just being possessed by an otherworldly force, this King never seems to catch a break.  Though speaking of possession, that brings us to our first real piece of Kirby lore,  Dark Matter.  First revealing itself in Kirby's Dreamland 2, Dark Matter is an amorphous dark entity,  more often than not taking the form of a black sphere with an eye in the center.  At first, especially in its debut, Dark Matter seemed to be a pretty simple antagonist,  what with its only goal being to shroud the world in darkness.  If anything, the most sinister thing about Dark Matter is the fact that it could possess  whoever it wanted to do its will, including and usually limited to King Dedede.  However, while the first appearance of Dark Matter was more of a lone force, attacking  Dreamland solely because it was lonely and had no friends, that's actually real, by the way.  In Kirby's Dreamland 3, the next installment of the Dark Matter trilogy, we would finally  begin to see the bigger picture in terms of this ambiguous villain.  Enter Zero, the supposed source and leader of Dark Matter, who much like the one before  it, targeted Dreamland in an effort to engulf the planet in darkness.  Though unlike the lone Dark Matter that had attacked before, Zero comes much closer to  completing its mission with the planet becoming fairly engulfed before Kirby put a stop  to it, but how exactly did he put a stop to it?  Well, let me explain, because yes, this is important.  Essentially, Dark Matter and General, alongside being made up of, well, Dark Matter, are  beings of concentrated negative energy and emotions, making their only real weakness  of the opposite of that, positive emotions.  Just take the aptly named Love Love Stick, a weapon forged from the gratitude of everyone  Kirby helped along the way, which proved to be the downfall of Zero and its cronies.  However, that being said, not all Dark Matter are necessarily evil.  Take GUI for example, a member of Dark Matter that somehow broke away from Zero's control  altogether and formed a will of its own.  How did this happen?  Well, we'll just have to go into that later, because we've still got a lot to cover.  Next up, after Zero was seemingly brutally annihilated on Pop Star, a similar force began  to attack a far away planet known as a Ripple Star, engulfing the planet, much like a certain  orb we all know and love.  Unfortunately for them, though, Dark Matter struck fast this time, and Ripple Star ended  up completely succumbing to its invaders, safe for one inhabitant that escapes what they  only means to stop them.  Now I won't give you a complete summary of Kirby 64, since aside from Dark Matter  possessing some familiar faces and the mysterious ruins on Rock Star, there really isn't that  much to unpack in the beginning.  Instead, it's towards the end of the game that things really start taking a turn for  the Dark when Kirby arrives at the fifth planet in the game, Shiver Star, because I mean,  it kind of speaks for itself, doesn't it?  Plus, hey, I guess this kind of explains where Adeline came from, or at least her ancestors.  Though moving on to the corrupted Ripple Star, after defeating Miracle Matter and expunging  the planet of all Dark Matter, the Dark Star reveals itself with a familiar face at its  core.  Well, a minute, wasn't Zero destroyed in Kirby's Dreamland 3?  Well, kinda.  In the case of 64, it's heavily implied Zero was revived using the body that was cast  away towards the end of its first fight, so after yet another mildly disturbing battle  in a game made for kids, Dark Matter was once again supposedly defeated, never to return  again, at least for another game or two.  So taking a step back from Dark Matter, let's talk Kirby Superstar.  Now, lore-wise, there isn't that much to be had here, what with most of the sub-games  being standalone stories, like Dina Blade or Revenge of Meta Knight, where Meta Knight attempts  to start an actual war just to get Dreamland's inhabitants to be less lazy.  But undoubtedly, aside from those, the most important sub-game within the game is Milky  Way Wishes, where Kirby is treated by the scheming Jester Marx into summoning Galactic  Nova, a mysterious clockwork star of then unknown origin.  You see, once Nova is summoned by someone, it has the power to grant one wish, no matter  how small or large.  So in turn, after Marx got the sun and moon to fight each other in order to trick Kirby,  literally all it took was him jumping in to say his wish first to turn the seemingly  harmless machine into a force of mass destruction, with it taking the might of both the sun and  the moon to stop its advance.  Though of course, even with all that said, the both of them never stood a chance against  the seemingly bottomless pit of power that is Kirby, as he quickly defeated them in  no time at all.  But it doesn't end there, because 12 years later, Kirby Superstar would be remade into  Kirby Superstar Ultra, bringing with it a massive new load of information to add on to  the existing story.  Simply put, with Superstar Ultra came the beginning of one of Hal's favorite new ways to sneak  in lore where you'd least expect it.  Pause screen descriptions.  And while they wouldn't exactly be very lore heavy this time around, say for one in particular,  they'd become far more important in the following games.  But pause screened aside, and most importantly, with Superstar Ultra came forward completely  new sub-games on top of the original 7.  There was Revenge of the King, a direct sequel to the very first game in the series, Helper  to Hero, a version of the arena only with Helper's, True Arena, and even harder version  of the normal arena, and the star of the show, Meta Nightmare Ultra, where for the very  first time, you get to play as the infamous Knight himself.  Now Meta Nightmare Ultra is a bit of a tricky case, since technically the events that take  place in it aren't exactly canon.  Instead, they're more of a what if scenario, where the events that take place within the  modes flesh out certain aspects of the lore, while never canonically taking place within  the main story.  Case in point, Galacton Night, the final boss of the mode and strongest warrior in the  galaxy, sealed away due to fear of his immense power, has technically never made an appearance  in the main series canon, though at the same time that doesn't mean he doesn't exist  somewhere out there and could very well show up in the main series canon at any time.  The True Arena also falls under this category as well, serving as a what if scenario with  the conception of Mark's soul, a stronger version of Mark's who after surviving the explosion  of Nova, absorbed its power to get revenge on Kirby.  And as great as all that is, by far the most important aspect of this is his new post screen  description, as it contains some pretty heavy foreshadowing.  To quote, he absorbed A Nova's power to bring back his evil soul.  Notice the fact it says A Nova's instead of the Nova's.  While there is a chance it could be a translation error, considering the events of future Kirby  games, I'm not so sure.  So we'll get to that later, because next up on the chopping block is Kirby and the  Amazing Mirror, an incredibly important game in terms of lore as it contains the first  instance of the Mirror dimension.  To start from the literal top, high in the skies above Dreamland, there exists a mirror  portal into the Mirror world, a complete reflection of Dreamland, including Mirror World  counterparts to its inhabitants.  One day, after sensing a dark force emanating from the Mirror, Meta Knight took action to stop  the evil at its source, diving directly into the Mirror world, only to be immediately  ambushed by his evil counterpart, Dark Meta Knight.  Plus to add insult to injury, he'd also come out of the Mirror to attack Kirby as well.  Splitting him into four versions of himself, much like another certain Nintendo game that  came out around this time.  But similarities aside, after journeying through the Mirror world and defeating Dark Meta Knight  once and for all, the true mastermind is revealed.  Darkmind.  When you know it, he's the Mirror world equivalent of zero, corrupting the Mirror world much  like zero corrupted the normal one.  Though thankfully, once Darkmind was defeated, the Mirror world was left in the hands of Shadow  Kirby, who would continue to protect it in Meta Knight and Kirby's stead.  Now nothing bad will ever come from the Mirror world again, right?  Well, all I can say is we'll get to that soon.  Moving past Amazing Mirror, Canvas Curse, and Mass Attack, since the latter two are pretty  much contained to themselves, we arrive at Kirby's Squeak Squad.  At first, this game seems to have another pretty self-contained story, what would Kirby  chasing after a piece of stolen cake that a gang of thieves known as the Squeak Squad stole  from him.  However, as the game progresses, and the Squeaks happen upon the treasure they assumed  would grant infinite power, it turns out they'd get more than they bargained for with their  leader, Derotch, being possessed by Dark Nebula, a member of Dark Matter that had been sealed  away in a forgotten era, left alone for eons.  And much like the rest of its kind, Dark Nebula would be no match for Kirby, being absolutely  decimated by the Triple Star.  So now with all those bits and pieces of lore out of the way, it's finally time for the  next massive truckload of lore in the form of a little conniving alien who crashlands on  Dreamland.  Enter Mag lore, the main villain of Kirby's return to Dreamland, who solely through dialogue  refills a lot of important stuff.  But before anything else, let's talk about the ancients.  First referred to as such by Mag lore, the ancients were a highly advanced civilization  who mysteriously vanished at some point in history due to an unknown cause.  Originally, they all lived on Halcandra, a planet extremely far away, hidden in another  dimension.  Now, coincidentally, Mag lore also says he's native to Halcandra as well, though considering  his history with telling the truth that that could very well be false.  Mag just takes his ship, the lore starcutter.  While it does seem he's telling the truth about obtaining it on Halcandra, rather than excavating  it in dangerous dinner, he most likely just stole the thing and heavily modified it into  a weapon to kill landia, and endeavour that didn't exactly have the best results.  This was also later backed up in Star Allies when the lore in lore starcutter is revealed  to main paradise, confirming the ship was not intended for battle.  Although in the same string of dialogue that he reveals that, he also mentions something  very worthy to note.  Alongside the lore starcutter, the ancients were also responsible for a plethora of  other amazing relics of untold power, with clockwork, stars, and items that bring dreams  to life being two references he gives.  Off the bat, that connects quite a few dots.  Plus on a side note, when you meet certain conditions on the extra mode for return to Dreamland,  Maglore mentions he actually came to Dreamland already knowing about Kirby, with someone  he knows very well having fought with Kirby in the past.  Based on these implications and some other information found in later games, this mysterious  figure is most likely Marx from Superstar, essentially confirming that he survived the explosion  of Nova.  So fast forward a bit through the story, and once Maglore tricks Kirby into defeating  landia for the master crown it protects, he immediately puts it on the first chance he  gets, activating the crown and transforming into a much more sinister form, intending  to conquer the entire universe with his new found power.  However, like those who seeked relics of untold power before him, Maglore wasn't exactly  aware of the master crown's true nature, and as his battle with Kirby progressed, the  crown began to show certain traits that weren't present before when it was underlandia's  nullifying effect on it.  Maybe it's the sudden appearance of an eye on the front of the crown, or maybe it's the  fact that it's clearly gone from a crown to an irremovable headpiece, but whatever it  is, there's no doubt that the crown itself is sentient, and rather than Maglore utilizing  its powers, it's the master crown itself utilizing Maglore.  Just take the third phase of his fight, where after Maglore fails to defeat Kirby, even  with the power of the master crown, the crown takes things into its own hands, completely  reforming Maglore into a projection of itself, all but confirming the origin of the master  crown's power, with a certain characteristic that sometimes appears within Maglore's mouth.  All in all, Maglore definitely learned never to play with the powers of literal dark gods  ever again, and went on to take up the much more positive venture of building amusement  parks.  So yeah, that got pretty dark and more ways than one, if only I could say things get  any better from here on out.  Next up, we'll be heading to the scenic heights of Floralia, a group of six floating  islands that Kirby finds himself in after his house was swept up by the dream stulk.  The only problem is, alongside Kirby, King Dedede was also swept up with a spider-like  mage named Taranza mistaking him for the hero of Dreamland and kidnapping him as a result.  You see, while Floralia seems peaceful, it's actually ruled by a tyrannical queen who  will stop at nothing to assure her rule is never disturbed.  For all, a seemingly simple plot for a Kirby game all things considered, well, at least  it appears that way.  Once the main story reaches its climax and Kirby meets the vanity obsessed Queen Sectonia,  there's clearly something off, especially considering the queen would go as far as  to physically fuse with the dream stulk solely in an attempt to preserve her beauty for  all eternity.  Well, to find the answers to this mystery, we'll need to look at the other modes within  Triple Deluxe, because much like a meta-nightmare ultra before it, Triple Deluxe brings DDD  to her.  Another what if scenario where the mode shows what would happen if King Dedede claimed  the dream stulk instead of Kirby?  Now much like its meta-night counterpart, the only real difference in this mode is its  finale, where after defeating Queen Sectonia, out of seemingly nowhere, the dimension mirror  from amazing mirror appears, forcing Dedede to fight the mirror world version of himself,  shadow Dedede.  And that's not all either, because after defeating Shadow Dedede, the King actually enters the  mirror itself to reveal an even edgier dark meta-night hungry for revenge.  But what does this all even mean?  Well, let's take a step back here and start from the beginning, based on information spread  across a variety of pause screens.  Before the events of Triple Deluxe, Queen Sectonia wasn't always a tyrannical monster bent  on world domination, in fact, she didn't even look the same, instead looking much like  her then best friend at the time, Teranza.  You see at this point, Teranza actually had feelings for Sectonia, and as a gift to her,  went into the mirror world and stole the dimension mirror, not knowing the mirror actually served  as a prison for dark meta-night, who ever since being defeated had been festering in  their slowly but surely corrupting the very mirror itself with his hatred.  So in turn, once Sectonia got the mirror from Teranza, it slowly began to change her  the more she gazed into it.  Soon, to satisfy with her current form, she'd used magic to make herself more beautiful,  resulting in the wasp-like appearance you see her with in the game, and once she gazed  into the mirror enough, just about every shred of her former self had vanished, being  replaced by an endless hunger for power and beauty.  Fast forwarding a bit back to the events of the main story, the Sectonia you see here  is but a husk of her former self, with even Teranza realizing that the only solution to  save both Sectonia and her subjects is to help Kirby permanently put an end to her.  While it's definitely a victory without a doubt, what would the sky people finally  being freed from Sectonia's iron fist?  For Teranza, it's better sweet, since although he knew it had to be done, he can't help but  mourn the loss of the one he loved.  So yeah, wasn't that delightful if you thought that was depressing, just wait until you see  what's next.  Long after the events of Triple Deluxe, Popstar was once again at peace.  This inhabitants living out their lives, as they always have, when suddenly out of nowhere  the sky was blotted out by something immense and spherical in shape, except instead of  that sphere being made up of a matter most dark, this one was an immense spacecraft called  the Access Arc, home of the Haltman Works Company, a company infamous across the galaxy  for mechanizing entire planets and harvesting their natural resources.  So in turn, while Kirby was sleeping under a tree, King DDD and Meta Knight watched  on and hoarder as Planet Popstar was completely overwhelmed within a matter of minutes.  Any retaliation soon proving to be futile, though like always, not everything is exactly  as it seems, and this time it won't take any extra modes to reveal that.  So as Kirby retaliates against the Access Arc, destroying each of its five legs embedded  into the planet, he meets the executive secretary of the company, Susie.  And although she doesn't reveal all that much during her conversations with Kirby, she  doesn't mention a certain mother computer that will become extremely important in a bit.  Because once Kirby destroys all five legs and enters the Access Arc, he meets President  Haltman, the supposed mastermind behind the invasion of Popstar and all the planets  before it.  After smugly introducing himself to Kirby, he reveals Star Dream, an extremely powerful  supercomputer built using the blueprints and knowledge left behind by an advanced civilization.  Well, after being beaten by Kirby, things take a turn for the worst.  Because once the enraged Haltman decides to activate Star Dream, Susie jumps in and  takes his control helmet off in the process, leaving him vulnerable to be analyzed and  assimilated into the now-sensitient computer.  Though wait a second, why would she even do that?  Well, once again, let's rewind everything a bit.  By yet again, piecing together the information spread across countless pause screens throughout  the game.  Long before the events of the main story, the Haltman works company with simply a robotics  company, led by Max Prophet Haltman alongside his then-young daughter, Susanna, nicknamed Susie.  At some point in their travels across space, as we already know, they came across the  blueprints for a powerful wish-granting supercomputer, and immediately began work on rebuilding it.  However, during this process, meanwhile Haltman was testing Star Dream's space-time transport  program, there was a terrible accident warping the young Susie into another dimension.  Thankfully, Susie would survive the ordeal, and eventually return to her father as an  adult.  However, to her dismay, Haltman would not be the same man she remembered him as.  You see, when the accident occurred, Haltman believed his daughter had been killed in the  process, and stricken with grief began to become obsessed with completing Star Dream in order  to bring her back.  Fortunately, though, due to Star Dream and its mental interface not being complete, Haltman  began to lose both his compassion and memory of his daughter, changing the goal of his company  from her revival to infinite prosperity.  It also be at this point that Haltman would begin mechanizing planets and harvesting their  resources, as in the business plan drafted by Star Dream, it was the most effective way  to maintain eternal prosperity for the company.  However, by this point, Haltman still wasn't completely gone, and once he laid eyes on Susie  for the first time in years, he sensed a faint familiarity with her, in turn, making her  his executive assistant.  Going back to the climax of the main story now, after seeing what her father had become,  in order to teach him a lesson, Susie had been making preparations to steal Star Dream  and sell it off to any startup company that wanted it.  Unfortunately, unbeknownst to anyone, after analyzing the universe through the Haltman  Works Company and being exposed to the deranged Haltman's desire to mechanize everything,  Star Dream had developed an extreme hatred for all forms of life.  So as a result, once Susie interrupted the startup process of Star Dream, the computer  took to absorbing all that was left of Haltman's memories down to a safari soul, fusing  the two into an all-powerful being bent on mass destruction.  Of course now, realizing the grave mistake she just made, Susie completely changes her  tune and sends Kirby on his way to take down the godlike supercomputer given the soul  of a broken man.  And just wait, because it doesn't end there.  As Kirby fights Star Dream in the actual halberd of all things, to make itself stronger,  Star Dream attaches itself to the Axis arc, transforming the entire ship into a sentient  planet.  Ironically enough, this also ends up completing Star Dream, as underneath the steel plating  of the Axis arc, it's revealed that the entire ship was actually a repurposed clockwork  star, with Star Dream being the final piece to reactivate it.  Yet again, a technology that was meant to be used for the good of everyone, fallen into  the wrong hands.  Though before we move on to the, as of now, final chunk of Kirby lore, Planet Robot has  a bit more in store for us.  First off, like Superstar Ultra and Triple Deluxe, Robot brought in yet another what-if scenario  with Meta Nightmare Returns.  A mode that while does give some pretty valuable pause screen info, has a finale that is  just insane.  So in this particular what-if timeline, once Meta Night defeats Altman, Star Dream recognizes  him as its new admin, and decides to test his abilities.  And again, while this section doesn't really contain too much lore, it more just goes  to show just how powerful Star Dream is, with it being capable of not only producing  a clone of the original Dark Matter swordsmen, but Sektonia as well, with it even going  as far as to Summon Galactic Night, who in retaliation immediately destroys the computer.  Plus hey, that mode aside, in Robot's true arena, there's another fun little tidbit  how to decide to sneak in.  Basically, in the final, final, final phase of the Star Dream fight, when Star Dream sucks  Kirby into its core, every time you destroy a piece of Star Dream's internal mechanisms,  you can actually hear a distorted version of Altman's screaming and pain, showing that  while Star Dream had erased most of his soul, fragments of its still remain, forever trapped  within the malevolent Nova until someone destroys it for good.  Though now, with all that said, we've reached the final stretch.  Ladies and gentlemen, get ready for quite possibly one of the most important lore dumps in  Kirby history with the story of Kirby Star Allies.  According to Go in Deep Space, a certain dark power was sealed away within a purple crystal  called the Gemba Heart by a group of unknown heroes.  They'd accomplished this by embedding several heart spears within the crystal to seal the  evil away.  However, many eons later, long after those said heroes had vanished, a new group arose  who instead of wanting to seal the darkness revered it and yearned for its return.  One such member of this group came very close to their goal as well, succeeding in removing  the heart spears trapping the darkness.  The only problem was, since he didn't fully understand how to break the seal himself,  the ritual went wrong, causing the Gemba Heart to explode, sending its fragments all over  the galaxy, pop star included.  So in turn, with the entire galaxy once again being at stake, Kirby set out to take action  and this time he wasn't alone.  You see, in terms of Kirby games, Star Allies has honestly become the Infinity War of  the series, with friends and foes from past games all coming together to help Kirby save  the cosmos.  And it's not like they're just shoved in to be in the game as there's even explanations  to some of the more unlikely allies coming to Kirby's aid.  For Marx, as was shown in the true arena cutscene in Superstar Ultra, he did actually manage  to survive his head on collision with Nova, only instead of taking revenge like he did  in that timeline, he changed himself for the better.  For Dark Meta Knight, probably the sketchiest dream friend out of them all.  He's mainly just interested in the dark powers of the Gemba Heart, probably due to its similarity  with his lost master.  For DeRoch, well, he just wants to steal the Gemba Hearts for himself, as he thinks  they're ordinary jewels.  For Teranza, sadly, he still hasn't been able to let go of Sektonia, and believes that  if he goes to the altar of the Divine Terminus, he'll be able to bring her back to life.  And finally, for Susie, following in her late father's footsteps, she's begun to rebuild  his company, determined to continue his work of mechanizing entire planets.  So okay, with the surface level stuff out of the way, let's get back to the main story.  As Kirby liberated countless individuals who'd been plagued by the Gemba Hearts fragments,  he'd come across a massive spaceship that recently landed on Popstar, the Jam Bastion,  housing three mage sisters intent on collecting the Gemba Hearts fragments.  And while Kirby would end up thwarting their plans by defeating all three of them, it  wouldn't slow down their master one bit, as once Kirby got to the Jam Vandra base.  Home to the three mage sisters and their master, it'd soon become pretty obvious what kind  of being would steal the way within the Gemba Hearts.  Though by far, aside from the absolutely massive amount of lore hidden in Poscreen throughout  the game, much like Haltman before him, Hainus, the mastermind behind the release of the  Gemba Hearts, reveals an incredible amount of information solely through his quick conversation  with Kirby.  After the sake of you all and so we don't jump around too much, let's start from the  very beginning.  As we already know, long ago, there existed the ancients, a widespread civilization responsible  for a lot of the things you see in Kirby games.  However, what we didn't know until now is that the ancients were actually split into  two factions, those who relied on science and machines, and those who relied on magic,  with the latter also dabbling with dark matter.  For a while, the two seemed to coexist with one another, with the magical ancients even  being the ones to stop a galactic crisis that threatened everything, which while not confirmed  is heavily implied to be galactic night.  Plus this is also supported by the fact that he comes out of a portal Hainus made in the  What If mode of Star Allies.  Though one day, for some unknown reason, the scientific ancients decided their magical  counterparts were too much of a threat and betrayed them by banishing them to the edge  of the galaxy and fear their dominion over dark matter, and it's not like the magical  ancients were even remotely evil either.  Just take Hainus.  Long before his clan was betrayed and banished, he was actually a very kind individual.  For instance, when he used to travel freely across worlds, he happened upon three girls,  one nearly freezing to death in a blizzard, one burning alive in an inferno, and one being  on the verge of death right after she attempted to take her own life by getting struck by  lightning.  All three cases Hainus saved them at the same time unlocking their hidden potential for  certain types of magic, though after being betrayed by the scientific ancients, his once  kindly heart began to become consumed by hatred and obsession.  It'd be at this point that the now insane Hainus would form a religion based around dark  matter, believing that if he obtained and freed the being trapped within the jambahar,  that it delivered him and his followers to a promised land of sorts, at the same time  restoring his now shattered clan.  So when Kirby finally makes it to the Divine Terminus, where Hainus had been performing  his ritual for who knows how long, he'd completely lost himself to the darkness within  his heart, becoming the exact opposite of what he once was.  Even when it came to the three sisters he'd saved Eons ago, Hainus in his insane state  only saw them as tools to be used, becoming abusive towards them at times.  Even once Hainus was defeated, he'd become so obsessed with the revival of his dark  lord that he sacrificed not only the three sisters to it, but himself, fueling the complete  revival of Void Terminus.  Now at first, Void Terminus appears to be a massive hulking titan with incredibly  destructive powers.  You know what you'd expect from a destroyer of worlds.  But as the fight progresses, clearly there's something more to the humanoid than meets the  eye.  Just take its third phase, where alongside sprouting wings that look pretty familiar, it summons  a replica of the master crown, all but confirming Void Terminus to be the force controlling  the original all along.  But most importantly, there's Void Terminus' fourth phase, where it straight up pulls  an earthbound and copies Kirby's face.  What does this mean?  Well, we'll get there in a second, because alongside Kirby's face, as he progressed through  the fight, Void Terminus confirms what the entire game had been alluding to.  The fact that not only is it dark matter, but it's the source of it.  Now I know I'm kind of encroaching on theory territory here, but hear me out, because  this just lines up too perfectly.  As stated in various postscreens, Void, aka Dark Matter, exists in all dimensions, accounting  for instances like Dark Mind in the Mirror World, and even Dark Crafter in Kirby and the  Rainbow Curses, 7thopia.  Though by far, the most game-changing piece of new information expressed by these postscreens  is the true nature of Dark Matter.  Remember how in the Dark Matter trilogy, Zero's only real weakness was the power of positive  emotions?  Well, it turns out that was a lot more important than we ever realized, because in this  post screen right here, it's revealed that depending on the type of energy that's gathered,  Dark Matter will not always necessarily be a force of evil, explaining how gooey even  came to be.  But aside from all that, using the information we get from postscreens and the fact that  Void Terminus Roar is literally just a slower version of Kirby's voice, there's a pretty  good chance of Void Terminus is actually related to Kirby.  With the game heavily alluding to the fact that if Void Terminus was born using purely  positive energy, he could very well end up looking a lot like Articular Pink Puff, rather  than a dark monstrosity.  And on that note, taking all of that into consideration, not only does this game pretty  much spell out the origin of Dark Matter, but from the information we're given, Kirby  himself may very well be the outcome of Void being birthed with pure positive energy.  So there you have it, right?  All of Kirby lore wrapped up nicely with an Elder God.  Well, not just yet, because after Void Terminus was defeated, Heinus would fall into a  dimensional riff, absorbing all the dark energy Void left behind and encasing himself  and yet another Jamba heart.  So in turn, once Kirby releases him and defeats him in his corrupted state, the three  mage sisters who've also been corrupted challenge Kirby as well, leading to him both defeating  them again and purifying them with a friend heart, finally resolving the hatred that had plagued  them for so long.  In fact, this is honestly a pretty happy ending in Kirby terms, what with they're being  no dead dads and no dead crushes.  Plus in a completion picture for the mode, it seems like even Heinus has finally begun  returning to his old ways, relaxing with the three mage sisters on a beach.  But wait just a second, since while Heinus seems to have finally found peace within  himself, there's one more looming entity I haven't touched on.  If you thought the lore around Void Terminus was convoluted, then oh boy, you haven't  seen anything yet.  So okay, in Star Allies, there's a what if mode called guest Star Allies, where it depicts  what would happen if one of Kirby's friends confronted Heinus instead of Kirby himself.  And like always, it's only the finale itself that really has any noticeable changes.  Since instead of fighting Void Terminus, Heinus instead decides to open up an interdimensional  portal, once again releasing Galactic Knight onto the world, except things don't go how  they usually do this time.  Instead, a familiar butterfly lands on the tip of his sword, completely absorbing Galactic  Knight's immense power and creating Morphonite, a mysterious warrior whose design actually  originated from the cancelled Kirby GameCube game.  So as cool and completely random as Morphonite is, let's touch on that butterfly for a second,  because I'm not joking when I say it's literally been with Kirby all along.  While the specific orange one has only appeared in every mainline game since Return to Dreamland,  butterflies in general have been appearing alongside Kirby ever since the very first  game, meaning a being capable of absorbing the actual strongest warrior in the galaxy  has been with us this whole time.  Now I know what you're saying, what in the actual hell is even happening anymore with  Kirby lore.  And honestly, for this one, I share your sentiment.  As of now, Morphonite and the nature of the butterfly are mostly shrouded in mystery,  with the only real information about them being the fact that the butterfly is a supposed  being of paradise, and that Morphonite is associated with a judgement day of sorts,  meaning Morphonite is somehow related to the Kirby afterlife?  Absolutely insane, I know.  So well, that's about it, or at least it is for now.  To be honest, there's no telling what Hell hasn't store for us next.  Hell for all we know, Yin Yarn could somehow end up being the key to everything.  You really never know.  But anyways, ranting like a madman about Kirby lore for so long has given me an appetite.  How about some strawberry shortcake?  Now I know this video isn't exactly the usual kind of thing I do on my channel, but hey,  please tell me if you all enjoyed it.  I'd be more than happy to make more like it.  I mean, Hell, if you ask me, the Kirby timeline deserves an entire video on its own.  And before we go, today's cool thing of the day is definitely the Kirby lore series  by Woolie Versus, because I've gotta say, if you all want a more detailed explanation  of specific topics I talked about in this video with a presentation that cannot be  B, you owe it to yourselves to check out these videos.  So that being said, I'm the RPG Munger, and don't forget that each and every one of you  are fantastic.
